This project builds an accurate model of the solar system using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), and real-life physics with [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation):

$$F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$
